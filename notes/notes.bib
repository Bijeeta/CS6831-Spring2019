% This is the bibliography.
%
% I use the following styles, whenever possible:

% - citation is lastname of first author, 4-number year, first non-stopword word
%   of title (all letters lower case).  In case of ambiguity can deviate, but pick
%   something similar. This is based on the Google scholar approach
%
% - Page numbers, physical location, editors, most often omitted
% - Author names (provide full names here, not initials for first name), Title,
%   Venue, Year included
% - Conference names can be replaced by widely understood acronyms
%    CRYPTO
%    EUROCRYPT
%    ASIACRYPT
%    IEEE S&P
%    USENIX Security
%    ACM CCS
%    TCC
%    Fast software encryption (to avoid confusion with Foundations of Software Engineering)
% - Journals one can cite in the journal format
% - Conferences can use inproceedings format
%
%
% Suggestions on bib maintenance welcome, we can refine this as we go on.
